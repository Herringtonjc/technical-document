            <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was
            created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General
            Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called Monty Python's Flying Circus and not after Python the
            snake.</p>
            <p>Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Although this version is supposed to be backward incompatibles, later on many of its
            important features have been backported to be compatible with version 2.7.This tutorial gives enough understanding on
            Python 3 version programming language.</p>

            <p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the
            programming languages is a plus.</p>

            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly
            readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical
            constructions than other languages.</p>
            <p>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are
            working in Web Development Domain.  Listed are  some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> - Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program
                before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
                <li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> - You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Python is Oject-Oriented</strong> - Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> - Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of
                applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some important characteristics of Python:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
                <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
                <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
                <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
                <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Following is an example of how to make a "Hello World" script in Python 3</p>
